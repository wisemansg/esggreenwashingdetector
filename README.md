# 🌱 ESG Greenwashing Detection & Credibility Assessment System

## 📌 Comprehensive System Documentation

## 🧭 1. System Overview

### 🔍 What is this system?

The **ESG Greenwashing Detection & Credibility Assessment System** is an **interactive, data-driven decision-support tool** designed to evaluate how well a company’s *public ESG claims* align with its *operational reality*.

Rather than judging whether a company is “good” or “bad,” the system answers a more precise and important question:

> **“Are a company’s sustainability claims credible when compared against available operational indicators, sector realities, and regulatory context?”**

This makes the system especially relevant in a world where ESG reporting is expanding rapidly, but verification and consistency remain challenging.

## 🎯 2. Why This System Exists

### ⚠️ The problem it addresses

Many ESG assessments today suffer from at least one of the following issues:

- Heavy reliance on **self-reported narratives**
- Overemphasis on **policies instead of performance**
- Lack of **engineering or operational grounding**
- One-size-fits-all scoring that ignores **sector and country realities**
- Black-box scoring that is difficult to explain or defend

This system was designed to **bridge the gap** between:
- ESG storytelling  
- Engineering data  
- Regulatory expectations  

---

## ⚙️ 3. What the System Does (In Simple Terms)

At a high level, the system:

1. **Reads ESG claims** written in natural language  
2. **Interprets operational data** provided as structured metrics  
3. **Considers sector-specific realities** (e.g., offshore wind vs oil & gas)  
4. **Adjusts expectations based on country regulations**  
5. **Detects inconsistencies** between claims and operational indicators  
6. **Generates a credibility score**, risk level, and explanatory red flags  
7. **Presents results visually and narratively** for easy interpretation  

---

## 🚫 4. What the System Does NOT Do (Very Important)

To maintain transparency and trust, it is critical to state what the system **does not claim to do**.

The system **does NOT**:

- ❌ Certify ESG compliance  
- ❌ Replace formal audits or regulatory reviews  
- ❌ Measure actual emissions directly  
- ❌ Access confidential or proprietary company data  
- ❌ Provide legal, financial, or investment advice  
- ❌ Declare companies “greenwashing” as a legal finding  

Instead, it functions as a **risk-screening and credibility-alignment tool**.

## 🧩 5. Inputs Explained (For All Audiences)

### 🏭 5.1 Company Sector

The sector input defines the **baseline expectations** for operations, emissions intensity, asset behavior, and risk.

Examples:
- Offshore Wind & Marine  
- Oil & Gas  
- Heavy Industry & Manufacturing  
- Construction & Infrastructure  

Why this matters:
- A “good” score in one sector may be unacceptable in another  
- Sector context prevents misleading comparisons  

---

### 📝 5.2 ESG Claims (Natural Language)

Users input ESG statements typically found in:
- Sustainability reports  
- Annual reports  
- Corporate websites  
- Investor presentations  

The system analyzes:
- Claim type (e.g., emission reduction, asset lifetime extension)  
- Strength of language  
- Specificity vs vagueness  

The system does **not** judge intent — only **consistency**.

---

### ⚙️ 5.3 Operational Data (Structured Metrics)

Operational data represents **engineering-relevant indicators**, such as:

- Energy use  
- Maintenance frequency  
- Asset replacement frequency  
- Downtime events  
- Asset age  
- Inspection backlog  
- Unplanned repairs  

These metrics act as **evidence proxies**, not absolute truth.

---

### 🌍 5.4 Asset Location (Geographic Context)

Location enables the system to:
- Apply country-level regulatory strictness  
- Reflect regional environmental expectations  
- Simulate real-world compliance pressure  

Example:
- Norway → higher scrutiny due to strict ESG regulation  
- United States → moderate scrutiny  
- Emerging markets → different expectations  

---

### 📅 5.5 Time Period

The selected year provides:
- Temporal context  
- Support for trend-based reasoning  
- Alignment with regulatory frameworks (e.g., EU CSRD timelines)

---

## 🧠 6. Core System Logic (Conceptual, Not Code)

### 🔗 6.1 Claim–Evidence Matching

For each ESG claim, the system asks:

> “If this claim were true, what would we expect to see operationally?”

It then checks whether the provided metrics **support, weaken, or contradict** that expectation.

---

### 🚩 6.2 Red Flag Detection

A **red flag** is raised when:
- A claim conflicts with operational indicators  
- Operational data suggests higher risk than implied  
- Asset behavior contradicts stated sustainability intent  

Red flags are **explanatory**, not accusatory.

---

### 📊 6.3 Confidence Scoring

Each claim is assigned a **confidence level**, reflecting:
- Strength of supporting data  
- Clarity of the claim  
- Degree of mismatch  

Lower confidence does **not** mean dishonesty — it means uncertainty.

---

### 🌐 6.4 Country Multiplier

Rather than penalizing companies arbitrarily, the system applies a **country multiplier** based on:

- Regulatory strictness  
- Disclosure requirements  
- Enforcement intensity  

This ensures:
- Fairness  
- Transparency  
- Context-aware evaluation  

---

## 📈 7. Outputs Explained

### 🧮 7.1 ESG Credibility Score

The credibility score (0–100%) reflects:

- Internal consistency  
- Evidence strength  
- Transparency  
- Contextual alignment  

It is **not** a sustainability score.

---

### ⚠️ 7.2 Risk Level

Risk levels are qualitative:
- Low  
- Moderate  
- High  

They represent **credibility risk**, not environmental harm alone.

---

### 🚨 7.3 Red Flags & Evidence

Each red flag includes:
- The claim involved  
- The operational mismatch  
- A confidence indicator  

This makes the output **auditable and explainable**.

---

### 🧾 7.4 Auditor’s Commentary

The system generates a **plain-language summary** similar to what an ESG analyst or auditor might write, highlighting:

- Key concerns  
- Regulatory exposure  
- Suggested focus areas  

---
